                <h3>Their Story</h3>
                <p id="tribute-info">
                    Since their inception in a Temple University apartment bedroom, Above the Mendoza has obtained great
                    success at home in the Lehigh Valley, in the city of Philadelphia, and in the suburbs between.
                    Following the release of their debut EP “Fast Forward” in August of 2015, the band has toured the east
                    coast and across the midwest, gaining a strong following from Boston to Chicago and everywhere in
                    between. With the release of their sophomore EP “A Shoulder to Lean On, But Not a Crutch”, ATM has
                    stepped up their game, showcasing the band's musical progression as well as lyrical maturation. The
                    content delves deep into stories of growing up, overcoming everyday obstacles, and life on the road. The
                    band is bridging the gap between classic 00’s and new school pop punk while throwing in their own twist,
                    creating a unique sound that is sure to make a splash in the music scene and leave listeners singing
                    along.
